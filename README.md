# Greetings, I am Luke! :wave:

I am a Software Engineering Graduate from Lancaster University, where I am starting my PhD in Computer Science in October. 

My interests are in HCI and how we interact with technology, especially in education for students with disabilities. 

If you'd like to reach out to me, you can find my twitter and linkedin in my profile.
